# cuple
<h5>Introduction</h5>

Cuple (Couple) - i think this name goes perfect with the whole idea!
So this is 2persons chat application meaning it is made for cuples 
Any type of couples basically meaning today we have a alot sort of relationships
like Lovers, BFFs, Friends, someother relationships too includes like Gay Lesbian etc that also includes in couples
so the idea is we all have one person whom we are connected to and we want to share whole world with them
like for ME its YOU! We wanted to talk to them regularly, We Like to share good/bad things with them! Share beautiful moments in short to spend some time together like couples do ♥



Why, Who, What, How, Where, Which 

Why?
So some important questions WHY we need this idea to be implement?
Lets see present platforms were we usually find couples together online!

1. Facebook : Too much crowded overfeatured social network! you get so many notifications all the day! spending time with ur favorite person is just so not possible! Fine you can see your partners photos and videos! other than that not ideal for perticulatly CUPLES
2. Messenger : OK, Couples can talk in Messenger! why not? Well yes they can but there are few thousand friends of your facebook see you online and wants to disturb you there. still no match
3. Instagram : Yet its photosharing platform people comes their to see their friends family ofcourse for their partners to stalk them LOL, but Instagram DMs Sucks! people comes and distracts you or you as a person could get lost in instagram feeds reels stories and posts. No match
4. Telegram/Whatsapp - NOOO - Boring, not for couples
5. Snapchat/Hike - Ideal for couples but still you can get distracted by regular friends who snaps you daily!

So we need something of a unique kind that targets Couple where they can hangout! where no one disturbs them and they can spend some good quality time together! which will be super personal no one disturbs them and which is so cool everyone loves to have their in their phone

Who?
who will use our app ofcourse couples that already discussed in introduction
So its a 2persons app so if i signup i can have only one connection whether be of any kind (Friends , BFF , Lovers) whatever that couple defines as their relation ship we'll give them special names in. Why 1 connection only? first of all to make it super personal, second it will build Trust in Couples (that he/she has that one connection that will listen to them that will care for them ) 

What?
Now i invited to app you downloaded it and we establised connection! We are a Couple!
We want and like to know eachother well! We like to chat( Text,Voice or Video ), we like playing small games together, we want to listen to music too! and also sometimes some R(♥) stuff too! if we have an dedicated app to do all the stuff! it will be super cool! it will not be just a chatting app but much more than that, also its not a dating app or matrimony app! its basically a couples app.

How or What Features?
Initially it will be a chatting app!
1. One Connection and Two person and they can communicate through 
    1.Text
    2.Images (GIFS),
    3.Voice & Video Call(Later) 
    4.Sticker(Later Personal Sticker like bitemojis but with animations)(Later), 
    5.Voice and Video Msg(that disappears if sender wants to)(Later)

2. We can create a Music Room. 
    when both partners joins the room they can listen to songs together with Sync! ( Like Listening to Arijit songs )
    also we can add their voice input as well whenever they wants to sing a song lyrics as they appear on screen. the Dope
    feature ♥

3. Later we can add some small games like Ludo or chess or games simple games like that if they get bored
4. Interactive sections for couples like Quizes of eachother and things like that register a Cuple score 
5. Love Calculator or Meter that changes according to factors and features they use in app ( if cuple interacts more means high love       score if not then low) that changes over regular periods of time. (this will make them stay in app)
6. ummm... thats it for now!

Where:
we need to target both the platforms IOS and Android! 

Which Platforms:
We need a Website, App both for IOS and Android (intially any one of them to test the idea)
Development Platforms
 1. FrontEnd: Android/IOS(Native) or React Native or Flutter (App)
 2. BackEnd: Firebase(for Apps this Suits best it will store our Realtime Database, Handles Push notifications and also Storage for Free initally until we target masses)
 3. For Website: we need a basic Introduction of our App website that describes our vision!
